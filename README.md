📈 Stock Prediction Model for AAPL using ARIMA
Welcome to the AAPL Stock Prediction Model repository! This project leverages the ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to analyze and predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices. The goal is to provide insights into potential stock trends based on historical data.

🔍 Overview
This project includes:

Data preprocessing and visualization
Time series forecasting using the ARIMA model
Evaluation of model performance
Predictions plotted alongside actual stock prices for better comparison

🧠 Model Details
ARIMA Components
AR (Auto-Regressive): Captures dependencies between observations.
I (Integrated): Makes the time series stationary by differencing.
MA (Moving Average): Models the error of the prediction.
The model is tuned using:

p (AR order): Number of lag observations
d (I order): Degree of differencing
q (MA order): Size of the moving average window
✨ Features
Forecast stock prices based on historical data
Interactive visualizations for exploratory data analysis
Customizable ARIMA parameters
